Mafia Bloods & The Dev


<h6>The Project - Mafia Bloods</h6>
<p>
    It is the typical old-school browser strategy clicker. Intended to be a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, for now we stick with the
    Online Role Playing Game. And In here you role-play a Mafia character. <br>
    Dedication is the key to achieve the goals within this universe and for that you need to put some effort on your account.
</p>

<p>
    The project is being developed with an open road-map policy and every suggestion can be implemented if it improves the community or the gameplay.
    This page will be updated along with the new mechanics that are implemented with the new patches.

<h6>A Developer & His Roadmap</h6>
<p>
    I am just a nerd, my friends call me Alphabetus or Alpha and I do like to code. <br>
    I quickly realized that if i wanted to feel the passion for a game I had to do it myself, so I started. <br>
    This project aims to sustain a playable <i>MVP</i>, and the technologies behind it are a mix between Ruby on Rails, Node-js, JavaScript and a bunch of standard libraries... I would not be surprised if you find some PHP as well..<br>
</p>

<p>
    If you do fancy the code, or the suggestion box, feel free to reach me directly and lets chat about the game.<br>
    Every suggestion is considered, and if every help is warmly appreciated.
</p>

<p>
    This project will take years to be fully finished. <br>
    Until then, enjoy our simple gameplay and the constant release of new features.
